# LYX_ARTIFACT_POLICY

Use exactly three artifact tracks:
1. `notes.lyx` (internal derivations, exploration)
2. `systematics_plots.lyx` (parameter scans, plot commentary)
3. `publishable_draft.lyx` (journal-facing validated claims)

Rules:
- Never merge tracks.
- Promote claims only with evidence link.
- Cross-reference equations/figures/tables/sections.
- Keep publishable draft clean and evidence-backed.
