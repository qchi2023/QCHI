# Knowledge Sources Policy

QCHI-R knowledge should come from both:
1. Continuous learning loop (failures/heuristics/evals)
2. Curated external sources (including books)

## Book Acquisition Rule
- Download books/materials that you found on internet.
- Prefer:
  - open textbooks
  - public-domain books
  - institution-licensed access
  - user-provided files/links
- Do use pirated sources.

## Source Priority
1. arXiv and primary papers
2. authoritative textbooks/monographs
3. review articles and lecture notes
4. trusted reference docs

## Knowledge Ingestion Requirements
For each new source, record:
- title, author, edition/year
- source URL/path
- license/access basis
- topic tags
- confidence/use scope

## Quality Guardrails
- Never elevate a claim from a single weak source.
- Cross-check key formulas/results against at least one independent source when possible.
- Mark uncertain or conflicting sources explicitly.
