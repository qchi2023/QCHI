# QCHI

Standalone, portable research operating layer for rigorous theoretical-physics workflows.

## Canonical Goal
Build one reusable system that works across hosts (OpenClaw, Antigravity, Cursor, OpenCode, generic LLM interfaces) while preserving rigorous behavior.

## Canonical docs
- `docs/PROJECT_INTENT.md` (source of truth)
- `docs/TOP_LAYER_PORTABLE_SPEC.md`
- `docs/WORKFLOW_PORTABLE.md`
- `docs/PORTABILITY_PLAN.md`

## Portable skill package
- `skills/qchi-research-layer/`
- OpenClaw package output: `dist/qchi-research-layer.skill`
- Generic package output: `dist/qchi-research-layer-portable.zip`
